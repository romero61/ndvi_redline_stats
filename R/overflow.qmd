```

Intercept - AVG NDVI is 0.0302when income is zero in region graded D

Income - As income increases NDVI decreases by .00000108

hocl_gradeA - the average difference in NDVI is 0.140 when the region is graded A

income:hocl_gradeA - the impact of income on NDVI is -0.00000211 in region graded A versus a region graded D.
